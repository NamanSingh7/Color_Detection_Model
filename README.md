# Color_Detection_Model
Detecting the color of the objects present in front if camera

The color detection model uses thresholding to detect objects of a speciﬁc color. The process involves converting the image to the HSV color space, applying a color range ﬁlter, and then performing morphological operations to improve the result. This model can have various applications, such as object tracking in robotics.

**#Inroduction****

**OpenCV** is a powerful tool for image processing. This presentation explores the development of a color detection model. Understanding the RGB color space and thresholding is key to this process.

**NumPy** is Python Package which stands for Numerical Python. This library consists
of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for
processing of array.
